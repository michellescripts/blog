It's been just over a week since I started Tone It Up! I've used the nutrition plan for Fit Girls a few times the past couple years, and while I loved the food, I started to get sick of the same recipes. It was time to switch things up!

So far, I'm loving the meals- and the daily workouts are definitely doable.

One dinner I love is Lentil Butternut Squash Soup. I really did not think I would enjoy this.. but I really like everything about it. It has just the right amount of spice and texture. I actually already made it a second time!

I also finally tried smoothie bowls. The first time, I used a fresh banana because I hadn't had time to freeze them yet- and without realizing the difference it makes, I was really confused as to why people make smoothie bowls. I actually just grabbed a straw to drink it. The next day, I decided to try again, and the frozen banana made all the difference. I LOVE this breakfast. It's almost as great as eating frozen yogurt with great toppings. Almost.

Zac and I have been hitting the gym on his lunch break. It's so great to have a gym partner.

A serious goal for 2017 is to improve my double unders. I mean, I only string together a max of 6, so there is a lot of room for improvement. Until then, I'll keep beating myself up. Literally, whip marks on my legs, arms and sometimes I'll need to ice a knuckle or two.

Every workout has been followed by a smoothie.. and I love, love, LOVE smoothies. I drink mine in like 2 minutes, while Zac takes a while- you know, drinking at a normal pace.

Lastly, Kindness Yoga is also holding a January Challenge. My goal is to get to 15 classes this month. I went to 4 classes last week, and they make such a huge difference in how I feel. It's been hard- I prioritize it after my workout for the day, and sometimes I can hardly hold myself up because my muscles are so tired. Still worth it.
