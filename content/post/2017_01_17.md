I can't believe it's only been 9 days since my last post, and I can't believe it's been 9 days! After a slow start to last week, the second half and weekend flew by! I think this post will be a long one...

(How great is that sweatshirt thought? It's IndyBrand and I want ALL THE THINGS).

Monday morning Zac was off to LA for work! Rex and I went for a great walk. The sun was out, and after I felt pretty engergized.

During the day I finished up some work on the computer. That night, Shadow hunters aired and I was SO excited about it. So, after yoga, Rex and I settled in for a great show. About half way through Zac called, and I was whispering. He asked what was wrong- Oh, nothing, just in the middle of a show- ya know? Haha but it was practically over so we still caught up on his first day.

Tuesday was GORGEOUS! I woke up and went to Yoga with one of my favorite teachers. After, I grabbed a lavender honey latte at Carbon Beverage. It was SO GOOD. I didn't get anything to eat, but look at the picture- I will NEED to go back and get a huge cinnamon bun someday (with Zac, to help).

Rex and I sat in the sun on our patio. It's the perfect area- you're totally blocked from the wind, but have full sun access! I was hot sitting in my tank.

Wednesday I woke up and decided to run some errands. We had some gift cards from Christmas- and that is my favorite way to shop! First I headed to Barnes and Noble- where I perused the shelves, tables, and displays before buying the two books I knew I was going to buy (but, as always, I was tempted). I also added a bunch of books to my Goodreads to-read section. Sighs. I bought the Handmaid's Tale, which I don't own and need to re-read, and Bridget Jones's Diary- which I have never read! Honest: I have high expectations there. We'll see when I get around to them. All my library holds came in at the same time, so prioritizing is an issue-

Next stop was literally right next door, Pier One. I use to buy wine glasses there EVERY YEAR. Seriously, they have these beautiful huge goblet like glasses (but more regular size than toyish)... with the perfect thin glass lip. Every year I would break at least 2, and replace them after Christmas. Until last year, when I bought a bunch of stainless steel (not as great, but still pretty great with the added bonus of not breaking into my disposal).  So this year, I found a soft fluffy pillow and a candle. Trying to be minimal means that I look for things that don't take up too much space, and are functional.

Since I was in the area- I also stopped at Ikea. I needed some food storage containers, and you can't beat their prices. I also stumbled upon a blanket/pillow cover display and got a few things to change up what I had on the couch (going along with the Pier 1 pillow).

Then, in the afternoon- I hit a wall. Just totally completely exhausted! I took a really long nap with my new pillow and blanket. So that was great. It was also still really nice out- so for the third day in a row, I was able to open the windows and get some fresh air in the apartment.

Wednesday night I went to an info session at Turing. (AND I HAVE SO MUCH NEWS FOR THAT WORLD- but that'll come in a later post). For now, just know that I got to wear my new shoes that I got for Christmas! Zac's sister gave them to me and I love them!

Before Zac got home on Thursday night I headed to Happy Hour at Avanti's with a friend. She invited a huge group, and everyone brought more people. There ended up being like 20-25 of us, and everyone was really great. Before, every time we went to Avanti, I would look at the bar area thinking 'I need to get here some night', and it was definitely what I expected. I can't wait to take Zac there some time for drinks- and to introduce him to some of the people I met that night!  When Zac got on the train, I walked the two blocks home. I was so busy talking, I got NO pictures. I'll have to work on that.

On Friday, I got the most unexpected and perfectly timed box ever. My dear friend, who I admire and am so lucky to know, sent me a holiday/care package. We've been talking a lot about life. Actually, we always do, and always will. I'm lucky to know her.

Zac was back from LA, so in the morning we took Rex for a walk and grabbed coffee at ink.

Friday I watched a couple episodes of Lemony Snicket- while doing some work. After Zac got off work- we FINALLY went and saw Rogue One! IT WAS GREAT. We had tried to go for weeks, but the AMC Flatiron was totally sold out. I'm a sucker for the lay down movie theater, so we kept waiting. We loved it!

Saturday we went for a long walk. It was nice outside, but not great. We walked to a few different areas we hadn't explored yet, so that was nice.

That night, we had tickets to the Mammoth game! We use to love going to lax games in Buffalo, and were pretty excited to have a team here in Denver. First we stopped for drinks and apps at a place called Public School 303. It was adorable! Decorated for school- they have flash cards on the walls, and menus that look like composition notebooks. Plus, the food and drinks (1/2 liter of wine on happy hour!) were fantastic. The wings reminded me a place my brother and I went as kids- they had the BEST wings, so that's a high compliment.

Then we walked to the game and had so much fun! I can't wait to go again. It was a really close game too- we won.

Sunday was FOOTBALL DAY. The games were CRAZY! I am stoked that the Steelers won, and I can't wait to cheer them on this weekend (and every other day, GO STEELERS!)

The rest of the weekend was filled in with dog cuddles, walks, and trips to the gym. We also started watching The Man at High Castle, and I think that's going to be a great show.

For now, I'll wrap up.. I have a delicious smelling coconut lemon curry to go eat. Exciting news coming soon.
