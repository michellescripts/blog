Since moving to Denver in July, I have been working hard to learn how to code.

Way back in middle school, I ran a website. It was for quotes- which I am sure were not properly cited, but the site was cool, the cursor had a tail, and it was definitely pink. I was self taught. After school, I would come home and sit at the computer for hours trying to figure out how the code worked. How I could pick it apart and put it together. Slowly figuring out how I could get my site to do something new. I loved it. Then, the quote trend passed, and I moved away from that side of learning.

In my first paraprofessional role, I found myself leading programs for kids. One of the first was a program using Scratch. I loved it. I had so much fun with those kids, and they were so creative. I realized that I was still really interested in learning how to code.

Then I interviewed for a new position. The interviewer asked what I wanted to learn for myself in the next year- what were my personal goals? In response, I said I wanted to learn how to code. That I had wanted to, and that it would be a good thing to work on. OF COURSE, I really had no time. I signed up for a few online classes.. but never practiced enough to retain anything I was learning. I even joined the mailing list for Girls Who Code in Syracuse, but never made it to a class.

Back in June, when we decided to make the move to Denver, I was taking Rex for a walk. I found myself once again thinking,

*I would really love to learn web development. Maybe, in like 10 years, I'll have the time to learn it and it can be a second career...*

 Then, I realized, why wait? Why wait to learn, what I have already been waiting to learn? So, I got home, and brought it up with Zac. Now, I have an amazingly supportive husband. He was all for it, and he's supported me every step.

So, we moved, and almost every day since August, I have been coding. Learning through Codeacademy, Udacity and Codewars. On the weekends, Zac and I will pair up and work on projects together. All along, I have been working to be good enough to apply for a bootcamp. This month, I applied. I interviewed. I was accepted. AND in just over two weeks I will be starting the immersive web development program at Galvanize Platte! I'M SO EXCITED.

I do want to mention right now that I still LOVE library science. It is my goal to combine all of the skills I have with the skills I'll learn.  I have zero regrets when it comes to the decisions I've made this far.

Now, I'm prepping for the course. It's intensive, so I'm trying to prepare myself ahead of time. Adjusting my sleep schedule, hitting the gym early, spending time with meal plans! I'm also still learning- and getting use to my new Macbook Pro.

I'm sure it's going to be challenging, but let's be honest, I love a good challenge. I love learning. I love being busy. And, I'm hecka excited. I can hardly wait...
