WEEK ONE GALVANIZE!

![Picture First Day](/images/2017_02/2017_02_17/firstdayofschoolpic.jpg)

On day one, we played the name game *Mighty Michelle* and met instructors, administrators, etc! Our first lesson was on 'How to learn.' They served us a great lunch- wraps from protein bar!

My legs were super sore from runday on Sunday, and standing through the name game killed me! So, I sat on the ground. Nothing like a first impression-

In the afternoon, we got another tour, received our key fobs and talked about the Galvanize Culture.

I got to meet so many dogs! Kiki, as previously mentioned, is our class dog. Well- she is our residents dog so she'll be hanging with us most days. The other two dogs belong to other instructors. Gosh I love being surrounded by them all the time!

After class on Monday, Galvanize organized a happy hour on the fourth floor to welcome us in. Everyone was invited (students, instructors, members).. and it was a pretty busy event! It was nice to meet some other people in the building.

Tuesday our first lesson was on POLYA- or how to solve problems. The day started with a warm up logic puzzle. My group didn't do so great- apparently it relied on a lot of math and that is not my strong suit! Things to work on.....

Next we learned some command line and VIM. We had three assessments to work on- and things were officially getting started!

Wednesday we started with another logic puzzle. This time my group nailed it. I still need to practice though. I think i'll grab a book next time i'm out.

Lessons on Wednesday were Git, Github and HTML. My table and I got into a serious discussion trying to figure out branching- hence our great use of the whiteboard table:

We did the same when trying to conceptualize the process of setting remote vs. upstream with Git

Wednesday night there was a meetup at Galvanize for CodePen. I headed home to take care of Rex and grab some (PREPPED) dinner before going back. It was a really cool showcase of things people had made- how they made them, and why. At one point, a nine year old girl got up with her dad to show off her html/css project. I just about died- and I'm pretty sure I can apply to work for her in 6 months (exaggerating, but, not by much- she might rule the world someday).

Thursday we started responsive CSS. I pretty much got into fights with flex box all day. Luckily I wasn't alone- and many of us found great tutorials and tools to help learn.

Can we admire Kiki in her natural state? She is SO CUTE.

We were also introduced to a concept called courage time. Pretty much we dedicate one hour to learning something we don't know. We don't need to have mastery in the topic- or even a fluency, but the point is that in one hour you can learn a lot- and accomplish a lot, in a topic you previously knew nothing about. I look forward to using courage time to delve into topics we might not cover in class (like design!)

Friday- the final day of module one, week one! In the morning we had a guest speaker. She was a previous student who talked about her time, and what she is doing now! Then it was scrimmage day! Through the day, the instructors met with all the students for one-on-one meetings. While not in a meeting- we were working on our own site (using the skills we covered this week). I worked on a personal site. At 3, as usual, the keg was tapped- but they also had wine on tap! I grabbed a glass- and got my Galvanize swag! It was a great way to end the week.

All week I packed my bag with Larabars as M4. It was the first time I tried them, and I absolutely LOVE cookie dough. The other flavors are really good too! They'll probably become a regular thing for me..
