I CAN'T BELIEVE ITS ALREADY QUARTER TWO. WHOOOP! Time is FLYING! The walk in on Monday morning felt pretty good. Ready to start again!

Monday and Tuesday we were reviewing Q1 materials to prep for our Wednesday Assessment. Tuesday was early day again. Proof that I was totally off my game is that I accidentally brewed two pots of coffee in one pot. I came out and saw it overflowing onto the counter- **ugh!**

Wednesday was assessment- and I loved it. We were given a wireframe and user stories and the whole day to deliver the product. It was a long day, but I enjoy the full projects that we work on.

Thursday and Friday our apartment complex was doing fire alarm testing so Rex was a gSchool student!

It's actually really nice to bring Rex in, because during breaks I go outside with him. I feel like the fresh air does good!

Thursday we learned a couple new things- first we covered Node.js- I have to take some time this weekend to review that in more depth..

We were also introduced to npm, and they did an AWFUL but very helpful exercise with evil npm packages. Pretty much- I know to review and research anything I ever download from npm.

Thursday gWomen held a lunch- it was nice to get together and chat. I look forward to meeting with the ladies more! I did think it was funny because a few of us had 'packed' lunches which were really just like food items in their original packaging.

Friday was a scrimmage day. We did paired programming and I LOVED IT. My partner and I worked together really well, and avoided so many small mistakes by working together. We finished pretty early, and felt good about what we did!

Zac brought me some lunch- Protos Pizza! I love it so much, and was crazy grateful that he brought it for me.

In the afternoon, I took Rex home. We got an email that alarm testing was done- and there was a large dog that was giving him some anxiety. We headed home in the rain, and on the way back I grabbed a latte at Ink for warmth.

All in all, it was a slower week for Galvanize. But I think we needed it, and I still learned a few important things. I think this quarter is going to be really hard, but I'm excited to be learning again!
