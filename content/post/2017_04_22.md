This week we rolled through information! We had a lot to learn before projects next week- and we all had some sort of anxiety about either getting groups, or starting the project. This week we dived deeper into SQL joins, auth & auth, REST/CRUD, server side validation and FINALLY got our teams.

When we came in on Tuesday, we some new writing on our wall. A new goal is for all of us to add to the wall before graduation. Because, we're the best cohort ever. SCWAAAAA.

Monday WE WON FEBRUARY. This game is epic, and I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

 Monday after class there was a happy hour to welcome the NEW COHORT! **G51** I met a few new students, and hung around for the start of a meetup.

 The rest of the week was a blur of blessons (breakout lessons) and diplomacy. We started a 15 person game, and it's pretty intense.

Zac was on business this week, so Rex came in one day.

Friday was the day we had WAITED ALL QUARTER FOR. But, we had to wait a little longer. In the morning, I headed up to the fourth floor for a latte. We have baristas who charge tips for coffee drinks m/f. This was the first time I went, and I'll be there again!

We started the day with a group standup! Kyle is so good at leading these. Then we settled into classroom 1/2 for a three cohort alumni panel! It was long, but there was a lot of good information in there- from people who just graduated, to those that have been in the field for a couple years.

THEN we got our groups! Our groups are for the Q2 project- which is a group project, and we'll be working together all day, every day, next week! I got teamed with James, Jules & Jackson. I'm pretty psyched to be working with them. James and I TA JS Foundations, but I haven't worked with the other two yet. It should be a fun week.

After groups were assigned, we spent the day brainstorming project ideas and submitting our proposal. Then we set some group guidelines. For instance- this weekend we'll be penciling-before-pixeling (Wireframes, ERD, feature lists, user stories), but after that- we'll be working in class only and trying not to take work home. We're also going to rotate scrum master everyday.

So, here goes the LAST WEEK OF Q2!!
