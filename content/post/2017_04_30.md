There are week where you do a lot. And then there are weeks where you don't. Then, there are weeks that are both.  Ha- this was that! School was so busy with projects- that outside of school- it was necessary to take it easy!

Zac was gone again- so Rex and I went on lots of walks. Other than foundations- the only remarkable thing to happen during the week was that it was [WEEK ONE OF THE BIKINI SERIES!](https://www.toneitup.com/) The food was great- and the workouts even better. I'll be buying the videos soon.

I haven't taken many photos, or posted much about it lately- but I'm still hitting the gym ERRRRY'DAY. Love tone it up!

It was a chilly week, but still really nice. But, we could all feel the snow coming...

Zac was home this weekend, and on Saturday he helped me tackle some problems we hit with our project. He explained auth/auth in a way I hadn't considered, and with his help I was able to cover a lot of ground.

Saturday evening I helped out at the Learn To Code Colorado event. It was a lot of fun, and I saw a lot of familiar faces from the Foundations class.

Saturday night, we went out to find something to eat. DOWNTOWN WAS CLOSED. AT 9, IT WAS WEIRD. But, Thirsty Lion was open- so we grabbed drinks and I had a side salad.

Sunday Zac had a tennis match in Cherry Creek- so I dropped him off and went to find shoes for Stephs wedding. SUCCESSS! Sunday night we watched Why Him! And got ready for the next week..

...which is **BREAK WEEK!**
